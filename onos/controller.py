    A unique controller.  Multiple controllers in a cluster will have the same cluster ID

    Fields / Attributes:
    uniqueId = (char):   A unique character string to identify the item.  This field is
                         combined with parent information to provide a unique path from the
                         highest level object to this item.  For the field itself, it
                         should be as short enough for display purposes but unique enough
                         not to clash with other items.  For instance, a GUID/UUID is always
                         unique.  A name like eth0 is not, so it may need to be prepended prepended
                         with it's parent unique ID. For instance, instead of 'eth0' you may want
                         to use <system-name>/eth0  or <system-name>/<bridge-name>/eth0.
