    Open a read-only libVirt connection to the provided address.   Depending on how libVirt is
    configured in /etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf, some connection methods may not be allowed. This will
    determine what types of connections may be supported.

    The format of the URIs differ depending if the address is local or remote, local URIs
    have the following format:

        driver:///system
        driver:///session
        driver+unix:///system
        driver+unix:///session

        where 'driver' may be one of the following:

            qemu    For managing qemu and KVM guests
            xen     For managing old-style (Xen 3.1 and older) Xen guests
            xenapi  For managing new-style Xen guests
            uml     For managing UML guests
            lxc     For managing Linux Containers
            vbox    For managing VirtualBox guests
            openvz  For managing OpenVZ containers
            esx     For managing VMware ESX guests
            one     For managing OpenNebula guests
            phyp    For managing Power Hypervisor guests

        Local URIs typically require the 'unix_sock_group', often 'libvird' and that the caller
        be a member of that group (see /etc/group and use 'usermod -aG <group> <user>' as needed)

    Remote URIs have the following format:
        driver[+transport]://[username@][hostname][:port]/[path][?extraparameters]

        where 'driver' is the same as above and transport is The name of one of the data
        transports. Possible values include tls, tcp, unix, ssh and ext. If omitted, it
        will default to tls if a hostname is provided, or unix if no hostname is provided.

        For transports, the following flags need to be set in /etc/libvirt/libvirtd.conf:

            tcp -> listen_tcp = 1
                   may want to set 'auth_tcp' to 'sasl' so TCP traffic is not in clear text

            tls -> listen_tls = 1
